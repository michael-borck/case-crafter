# Case Crafter Implementation Tasks

Based on the Case Crafter PRD (docs/case_crafter_prd.md)

## Relevant Files

- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Main Tauri application entry point and backend setup
- `src-tauri/src/database/mod.rs` - SQLite database connection and schema management
- `src-tauri/src/models/` - Database models for case studies, users, configurations
- `src-tauri/src/ai/mod.rs` - AI integration module for local (Ollama) and cloud AI services
- `src-tauri/src/config/mod.rs` - Configuration management for dynamic input system
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard interface component
- `src/components/CaseStudyGenerator/` - Case study generation interface components
- `src/components/ConfigurationManager/` - Administrative configuration interface
- `src/components/ContentLibrary/` - Content library and search interface
- `src/components/AssessmentTools/` - Assessment generation and management tools
- `src/hooks/useAI.ts` - Custom React hook for AI service integration
- `src/store/` - State management for application data
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions for all data models
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Input validation and business rules engine
- `tests/` - Unit and integration test files for all components

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx` and `Dashboard.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run frontend tests and `cargo test` for Rust backend tests.
